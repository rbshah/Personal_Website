							<h2><br />
							Built an Invoice Management Software  </h2>
							<p>I built an invoice management software through the use of Tally Definition Language (TDL), Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, JavaScript.<br /></p>
							<p>
								Tally is widely used for business finance management, but it processes companies separately. My solution addresses this limitation by linking a web application on a Flask server to Tally. When a user enters the  contract details like Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity and Price into the web application, it integrates smoothly and in real time with Tally via RabbitMQ and Celery. Once the billing is finalized in Tally, my software promptly updates the web application and database, streamlining the management of multi-million dollar finances across various businesses.
