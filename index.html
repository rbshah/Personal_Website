								<h2>
								Education at Beloit College</h2>
								
								<p> I took Intro courses from three different domains during my first year. In my second and third years, I concentrated on advanced Computer Science courses and Capstone classes, which are required for graduation.‚Äù Capstone courses helped me apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems and gain deeper insight into the programming field.
									
									I learned to code SQL and understand important Database concepts through the Database Capstone class in the Spring of 2024. I have also taken Maths courses like Discrete Structures, Calculus 2, Differential Equations, and Vector Calculus.

							<h2><br />
							Built an Invoice Management Software  </h2>
							<p>I built an invoice management software through the use of Tally Definition Language (TDL), Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br /></p>
							<p>
								Tally is widely used for business finance management, but it processes companies separately. My solution addresses this limitation by linking a web application running on a Flask server to Tally. When a user enters contract details such as Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity, and Price into the web application, it integrates smoothly and in real-time with Tally via RabbitMQ and Celery. Once the billing is finalized in Tally, my software promptly updates the web application and database, streamlining the management of multi-million-dollar finances across various businesses.

							<h2> Software Engineering Fellowship Program <br /></h2>
							
							
							<p> The Headstarter Fellowship is a 7-week virtual summer Software Engineering Program, from July 22nd to September 8th, that enables students to work on industry-standard projects! 

								In this fellowship program, I am working with my four teammates to: 
								- Build 5 AI projects
								- Participate in hackathons
								- Final project that takes a startup's current backlog and builds it to meet business requirements.<br /> </p>

							<p> Additionally, I have regular Q&A sessions, meetings, and info sessions with software engineers from industry-leading companies like Google, AMD, Microsoft, and Apple, which are helping me understand the working techniques and skills required for the real world.
